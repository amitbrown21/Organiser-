# Organiser
This program allows you 3 things:
1. Organise a messy folder by sorting all files in it by extenstion and putting them in a folder of the extention name
2. Organise a folder filled with episodes of diffrent tv shows,anime and so on, and organising them by series name in a folder (only MKV files)
3. Clean the names of folders that contain an [""] in them and remove them
The dist folder contains an EXE file to run the progrem with, after the program ran, it will create a log file containing all changes that were made
